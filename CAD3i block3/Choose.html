                Yes, you see it right. You can go to space with a Tesla. As you can imagine, it's not the most spaciuos
                spaceship that we have. But you can go and "drive" around space as much as you want until you are tired
                of sitting. In that case you can just unbelt and start flying out and stretch yourself. If you worry
                about going away too far don't worry, you will be buckled with strings attached to the car so that you
                don't lose one another. You will not be able to travel too much through space because of food
                limitations. But , in case you want to stay longer, you can keep in touch with the other spaceships
                which might take you on board if they have enough space.
